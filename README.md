### 🎵 Beyond the Screen

- 🎶 When I'm not glued to the screen, you'll find me indulging in my other passion: hip-hop. Lyrics and beats inspire me and keep me focused and motivated.
- 🐶 Animals are my therapy and joy. I can spend hours exploring with my dog or relaxing with my cats. No matter how challenging a day may be, I always find solace in their company.
